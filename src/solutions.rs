    "I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell 
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell 
In ecstasy \
     in the back of me 
Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's 
Hittin' hard and the \
     girlies goin' crazy 
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy. 

I'm lettin' my drug kick in 
\
     It controls my mouth and I begin 
To just let it flow, let my concepts go 
My posse's to the \
     side yellin', Go Vanilla Go! 

Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be 
And if you don't give \
     a damn, then 
Why you starin' at me 
So get off 'cause I control the stage 
There's no \
     dissin' allowed 
I'm in my own phase 
The girlies sa y they love me and that is ok 
And I can \
     dance better than any kid n' play 

Stage 2 -- Yea the one ya' wanna listen to 
It's off my \
     head so let the beat play through 
So I can funk it up and make it sound good 
1-2-3 Yo -- \
     Knock on some wood 
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious 
\
     Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious 
I'm an effect and that you can bet 
I can take a fly girl \
     and make her wet. 

I'm like Samson -- Samson to Delilah 
There's no denyin', You can try to \
     hang 
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style 
Over and over, practice makes perfect 
But not \
     if you're a loafer. 

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls 
Soon -- Oh my God, \
     homebody, you probably eat 
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it! 

VIP. Vanilla Ice \
     yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino 
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino 
So punks \
     stop trying and girl stop cryin' 
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin' 
'Cause \
     why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue 
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along 
All \
     through the ghetto groovin' this here song 
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse. 

Steppin' so \
     hard like a German Nazi 
Startled by the bases hittin' ground 
There's no trippin' on mine, \
     I'm just gettin' down 
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic 
You trapped me once and \
     I thought that 
You might have it 
So step down and lend me your ear 
'89 in my time! You, \
     '90 is my year. 

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it 
Your body's gettin' hot, so, \
     so I can smell it 
So don't be mad and don't be sad 
'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can \
     call me Dad 
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure 
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do \
     the dance to cure 
So come up close and don't be square 
You wanna battle me -- Anytime, \
     anywhere 

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong 
So come on, everybody and \
     sing this song 

Say -- Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go 
play that \
     funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go 
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music \
     till you die. 

Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear 
Play that funky music \
     white boy you say it, say it 
Play that funky music A little louder now 
Play that funky \
     music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on 
Play that funky music \n"
